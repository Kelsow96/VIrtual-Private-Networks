<h2> What is a Virtual Private Network (VPN)?</h2>

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a service that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the Internet. It allows users to send and receive data as if their devices were directly connected to a private network, ensuring privacy and security by masking the user's IP address and encrypting data traffic. VPNs protect sensitive information, maintain privacy, and access restricted or geo-blocked content.
